                For a number of years, I have been in contact with Sam, discussing job opportunities in the Interim Engineering market. His knowledge of the market and links within the business are excellent. He took the time and made the effort to understand my ideal job position and matched me with my present employer. I highly recommend his attention to the needs of both his Candidates and business Clients. Added to this attention to detail, and his full understanding of his Candidates skill set, and what they are able to offer to potential employers, his  friendly and cheerful personality have made the process of moving to new employment a stress-free experience.',

                    I am very pleased with the service you have offered over the last 5 months or so.
                    Your communication is excellent which made the recruitment process simple and
                      straightforward. Since the start of my contract, you have always taken the 
                      time to check in on me by phone to make sure all is well. There has never 
                      been any issue with the payment of my invoice, which is always dealt with 
                      promptly. Once again, many thanks.</h1>
